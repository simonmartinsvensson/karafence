# KaraFence

## Theme

**KaraFence** is a tower defense game set at a karaoke night gone hostile.

- **The goal:** defend the **singer on stage** from waves of disruptive audience
  members walking up the aisles toward the stage.
- **Towers** are **singers and instruments** (e.g. backup vocalists, a drummer,
  a bassist) that you place along the aisles to fend off the crowd.
- **Enemies** are **bad-audience archetypes** marching up the lanes:
  - **Hecklers** — loud, throw insults that disrupt nearby towers.
  - **Phone-scrollers** — slow, oblivious, soak up damage.
  - **Drunk uncles** — erratic movement, hard to target.
  - **Stage-rushers** — fast; make a beeline for the stage.

If too many disruptors reach the stage, the show is over.

## Stack

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** — dev server and bundler.
- **[Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/)** — game framework (rendering, scenes, input).
- **TypeScript** — strict mode, bundler module resolution.

## Rendering config

Defined in `src/main.ts`:

- `pixelArt: true` — crisp scaling for pixel-art assets.
- `Phaser.Scale.RESIZE` — the canvas always fills the `#game` element (the full
  viewport), so **1 game unit == 1 CSS pixel** and the scenes lay themselves out
  responsively per orientation rather than being letterboxed.
- `disableContextMenu: true` — no long-press menu on the canvas. `index.html`
  also sets `touch-action: none`, `user-scalable=no`, etc. and `main.ts`
  preventDefaults pinch/double-tap so native mobile gestures never fire.
- Dark background (`#0b0b12`).
- The `Phaser.Game` instance is exposed as `window.game` (a harmless debug aid
  that also lets headless smoke tests drive scenes / read game state).

## Responsive layout (mobile portrait + landscape)

The whole game is playable on Android Chrome in both orientations.

- `computeScreenLayout(vw, vh)` (`src/systems/grid.ts`) splits the live viewport
  into a top **HUD strip**, a bottom **control bar** (the one-thumb Menu / Shop /
  Fast Forward buttons), and the **board region** between them.
- **Board container**: the lane grid is built once at a fixed board-local tile
  size (`BOARD_TILE` in `config.ts`) into a `board` container with ordered
  z-`layers` (`BoardLayers`: tiles/range/enemies/towers/projectiles/fx). Every
  board object (tiles, towers, enemies, projectiles, FX) is added to a layer, so
  `fitBoard()` reflows the entire board on resize/rotation with a single
  scale+position transform — no per-object relayout, and layer order preserves
  the old depth stacking. Pointer taps are converted to board-local coords via
  `pointerToBoard()`.
- **Screen furniture** (HUD, control bar, boss bar, combo/status text, panels,
  end overlays) lives in scene root in viewport coordinates and reflows in
  `GameScene.relayout()` / `MenuScene.rebuild()` on every `resize` event.
- **Touch targets**: `TOUCH_MIN` (44px) is the floor for every interactive
  control; the build/upgrade/shop panels (`src/ui/*`) and both scenes size their
  buttons/rows to at least that and center on the viewport. The UpgradePanel is
  anchored just above the control bar so Activate stays within thumb reach.

## Scene flow

```
BootScene  →  MenuScene  ⇄  GameScene
```

- **BootScene** logs `"boot"` and starts `MenuScene`.
- **MenuScene** (`src/scenes/MenuScene.ts`) is the **mode-select** landing screen
  (see "Game modes"): a neon **KARAFENCE** wordmark and two large mode cards
  (**Endless** / **Story**, each with **Play / New Game** + **Resume** when a run
  is saved), a **Meta Upgrades** modal to spend earned stars, and a **Records**
  modal (lifetime stats + best endless wave). Reads the persisted meta fresh on
  each entry; `startMode()` persists the chosen mode and hands the right
  `{ mode, levelId, resume }` to the GameScene.
- **GameScene** (`src/scenes/GameScene.ts`) renders the lane grid + stage and
  orchestrates gameplay. It takes `{ mode, levelId, resume }` via `init()` (which
  also resets all per-run state, since Phaser reuses the scene instance), loads
  the map from `LEVEL_BY_ID`, applies meta modifiers, and on end-of-run returns
  to `MenuScene` (or, in story mode, advances to the next chapter via
  `scene.restart`). A **≡ Menu** button leaves mid-run (the run auto-saves).

## Game modes

Two modes, picked on the mode-select screen and persisted (`karafence:mode`);
`GameMode` lives in `src/data/modes.ts` (`MODES` also drives the menu cards).

- **Endless** (`src/data/modes.ts`, `ENDLESS` in `src/data/waves.ts`) — survival
  on The Dive Bar. After the 20 authored waves, `WaveManager.generateWave(index)`
  builds waves procedurally: `count = baseCount + floor(index·1.4)`, `hp = 1 +
  index·0.12`, `speed = min(2.5, 1 + index·0.04)`, a rotating boss every 5 waves
  that gets tougher each cycle (`bossHpScale`). No win condition / no stars; game
  over shows a **"YOU SURVIVED X WAVES"** screen (run kills / gold / combo, best
  wave) with **Try Again** + **Menu**, and banks the best to `karafence:endless:best`.
- **Story** (`src/data/story.ts`) — a campaign across both maps (Dive Bar →
  Grand Stage) with character dialogue. Star ratings still apply per chapter.
  After a wave clears, `GameScene` looks up `beatsAfterWave(levelId, n)` and plays
  any matching beats through the **DialogueOverlay** (`src/ui/DialogueOverlay.ts`)
  during the intermission (the countdown holds while a beat is on screen); the
  `waveAfter: 0` beat plays at chapter start (wave 1 is deferred until it's
  dismissed). Clearing wave 20 scores stars, shows a **Chapter Complete** screen
  and `scene.restart`s into the next chapter — or, on the last chapter, the final
  **victory** screen. Progress persists to `karafence:story:progress`
  (`{ levelId, completedChapters, wavesCleared }`).
- **HUD**: the wave counter shows `ENDLESS · Wave X` (no cap) or
  `STORY · Wave X/20` so the active mode is always legible.
- **Dialogue content** is 100% data in `src/data/story.ts` — `CHARACTERS` (ALEX,
  VY, MAX, THE JUDGE; name + portrait tint) and `STORY_BEATS` keyed by `LevelId`
  (`{ waveAfter, character, lines }[]`). The portrait is one grayscale
  `TX.portrait` bust tinted per character (visual-novel style).

## Map / lanes

Maps are **data-driven**. A level is authored as ASCII rows + a legend and
parsed into a `MapDefinition` by the shared `parseMap` (`src/data/parseMap.ts`):

- `src/types/map.ts` — `TileType` (`stage` / `aisle` / `build`) and
  `MapDefinition` (grid, lane rows, spawn/stage columns, plus `id`,
  `enemySpeedMultiplier`, `starGoals`, and per-tile `colors`).
- `src/data/level1.ts` — **"The Dive Bar"**: 16×11 grid, **5 aisles**, normal
  speed. `src/data/level2.ts` — **"The Grand Stage"**: 16×9 grid (bigger tiles =
  wider-looking lanes), **3 aisles**, `enemySpeedMultiplier: 1.35`, and a cooler
  flat palette. `src/data/levels.ts` is the registry (`LevelId`, `LEVELS`,
  `LEVEL_BY_ID`). Edit/add ASCII to author a map; tile colors come from the map's
  `colors` (default palette in `parseMap`).

`GameScene` builds the map into the board container at the fixed `BOARD_TILE`
size, then `fitBoard()` scales + centers that container into the board region
(see "Responsive layout"). The singer is a placeholder rect + label in the stage
zone, with a `damageSinger()` hook for when enemies reach the stage.

## Meta-progression / save-load

- **Stars** (`src/data/meta.ts`): finishing a level scores 0-3 stars — one each
  for losing ≤ `maxLivesLost`, spending ≤ `maxGoldSpent`, and reaching `minCombo`
  (thresholds live in the map's `starGoals`). The **best** rating per level is
  kept. Total stars earned across levels are a spendable currency; available =
  earned − spent.
- **Meta-upgrade tree** (`META_UPGRADES`): permanent, account-wide, bought with
  stars — *Opening Act Budget* (+5%/tier starting gold), *Group Discount*
  (−5%/tier tower cost), *Crowd Memory* (+0.5s/tier combo window). `metaModifiers`
  turns purchased tiers into the run modifiers `GameScene` applies (starting gold,
  `towerCost()`, `comboWindow`).
- **Lifetime stats**: total kills, waves survived, highest combo — incremented in
  `GameScene` and persisted at wave-clear / run-end.
- **Persistence** (`src/systems/storage.ts`, localStorage, hardened with
  try/catch): the **meta** slot (`karafence:meta`) holds stars/upgrades/lifetime;
  a separate **run** slot per **mode+level** (`karafence:run:<mode>:<id>` — so an
  endless run and a story run on the same map don't collide) holds an in-progress
  run (resume wave, gold, lives, scoring, and serialized towers via
  `TowerManager.serialize/restore` + `Tower.toSave/restore`). Plus the mode slots:
  `karafence:mode` (last-selected), `karafence:endless:best` (best endless wave),
  `karafence:story:progress` (campaign chapter/waves). The run auto-saves
  on tower/economy changes and wave boundaries, and resumes by replaying the saved
  wave from its start; it's cleared on victory or game over.

## Enemies / waves / bosses

- `src/data/enemies.ts` — data-driven types. Standard: **Heckler**, **Phone
  Scroller** (tanky), **Drunk Uncle** (erratic), **Stage Rusher**
  (`bypassFirstTower` — immune to the first tower that hits it), **Critic**
  (`criticAura` + `reviewPenalty` — cuts the reward of enemies dying nearby),
  **Superfan** (`splitInto` — splits into 2 Hecklers on death), **VIP**
  (`deflectChance` + big reward). Bosses (flagged with `boss`): **Heckler King**
  (taunt freezes towers in radius), **Mic Grabber** (steals gold + resets combo
  at the stage), **DJ Who Wouldn't Stop** (`shield` + summons Hecklers),
  **Talent Show Judge** (multi-phase). `BOSS_CONFIG` tunes the abilities.
- `src/data/waves.ts` — 20 waves; bosses at 5/10/15/20 (`boss()` groups set
  `noScale`). `DIFFICULTY` / `scaledCount` scale count/hp/speed per wave.
- `src/systems/Enemy.ts` — waypoint movement, HP + shield bars, `takeDamage()`
  (handles deflect / first-tower bypass / shield), `applySlow()`, `rewind()`,
  and `isBoss` / `hpRatio` for the boss bar.
- `src/systems/WaveManager.ts` — round-robin spawns, `spawnAt()` (splits + boss
  summons), Superfan split on death; callbacks `onReachStage` / `onKill` /
  `onWaveCleared` / `onBossSpawn`.
- Boss abilities + the full-width **boss health bar** are driven by `GameScene`
  (`driveBoss`/`showBossBar`); `Tower.freeze()` + `TowerManager`
  `attackSpeedMultiplier` back the Heckler King taunt and Talent Judge phase 3.

## Towers / combat / economy

- `src/data/towers.ts` — data-driven types + `STARTING_GOLD`. Attackers:
  **Lead Singer** (medium, single target), **Drummer** (short range, AoE splash
  pulse), **Keyboardist** (long range, slow firing, applies a slow debuff),
  **Bass Player** (medium range, low-frequency "bass blast" that knocks every
  enemy in range back `knockbackTiles`). Support (`attacks: false`, no upgrade
  tree): **Backup Singer** (short range, `buffAttackSpeed` aura speeds up nearby
  attacking towers), **Hype Man** (wide range, `goldBoost` +50% gold and
  `comboBoost` faster combo for kills in range). Each has cost, range (tiles),
  damage, attack speed, a default targeting strategy, and an `ability` (see
  below).
- `src/systems/Tower.ts` — picks a target per its targeting strategy
  (`first` / `last` / `strongest`, cycled by selecting the tower); single-target
  towers fire a homing `Projectile`, splash towers pulse damage to all in range,
  Bass Players pulse a knockback (`Enemy.knockback`), support towers don't fire.
  Range circle shows on hover/select.

### Active abilities

Every tower has one cooldown-gated active ability (`TowerAbility` in
`towers.ts`), triggered from the **Activate** button in the upgrade panel:
Lead Singer **Power Note** (single-target nuke), Drummer **Drum Roll** (3s stun
AoE), Keyboardist **Chord Bomb** (10s slow field), Backup Singer **Choir Boost**
(10s 2x fire for all towers), Bass Player **Drop the Bass** (knock all enemies
back 5 tiles), Hype Man **Crowd Surf** (next 10 kills pay 3x gold). `Tower`
tracks the cooldown and draws it on the sprite (a shrinking dark wedge + a gold
"ready" ring). The effects live in `GameScene.activateAbility`; `TowerManager`
holds `abilitySpeedMultiplier` (Choir Boost), `applySupportBuffs` (Backup Singer
aura), and `hypeAt` (Hype Man gold/combo aura), and Chord Bomb fields are ticked
by `GameScene.tickSlowFields`.
- `src/systems/Projectile.ts` — homing dot; applies damage (+ any slow) on hit.
- `src/systems/TowerManager.ts` — placement validation (buildable + empty),
  the valid/invalid build overlay (the selected tile gets a faint green fill, a
  tower-base shadow, and a tween-pulsed bright-green border; `GameScene`
  red-flashes a tapped non-buildable tile), selection UI, projectile updates.
- `src/ui/BuildPanel.ts` — modal tower picker (tap a buildable tile to open);
  each card shows the tower's generated sprite (~55% of card height) inside a
  per-type accent border (`ACCENT` map), its name and cost, and greys out /
  dims unaffordable towers.
- **Economy:** start with `STARTING_GOLD`, earn `enemy.reward` on kill
  (`WaveManager` `onKill`), spend gold to place towers. Gold shows in the HUD.

## Upgrades / selling

- `UPGRADES` in `src/data/towers.ts` — per tower, two 3-tier paths (A = power,
  B = utility). Each `UpgradeTier` has a `label`, `cost`, stat deltas, and/or
  effect flags (`pierce`, `multiTarget`, `doubleFire`, `slowOnHit`, `stunOnHit`).
  Signature (tier-3) effects: Lead Singer A=piercing shot / B=crowd-control slow;
  Drummer A=drum-solo stun / B=double kick; Keyboardist A=freeze (full stop) /
  B=chord strike (3 targets).
- `Tower` recomputes effective `RuntimeStats` from base + purchased tiers, and
  tracks `totalSpent` for the sell refund. **BTD6 constraint** (`canUpgrade`):
  a path may pass tier 1 only if the other path is at tier ≤ 1 (so only one path
  fully maxes). Tier pips render on the tower (red = A on top, cyan = B below).
- `src/ui/UpgradePanel.ts` — opens on selecting a placed tower: both paths
  (pips + next label/cost), a targeting toggle, and **Sell** (`SELL_REFUND` =
  60% of `totalSpent`). Affordability is snapshotted when the panel is (re)built.
- `GameScene` wires `TowerManager.onSelectionChange` → open/close the panel, and
  owns the gold spend/refund on upgrade/sell.

## Combo, economy depth, pacing, shop

All orchestrated by `GameScene`:

- **Crowd Hype combo** — each kill within `COMBO_WINDOW` (2.5s) of the last
  raises the combo; kills pay `reward + reward·COMBO_BONUS·combo`. A "🔥 HYPE
  x{n}" meter shows; at x5+ a "THE CROWD GOES WILD!" screen flash fires. The
  combo resets if no kill lands within the window.
- **Interest** — on each wave clear, `+floor(gold / 10)` is banked (rewards
  saving), shown as a floating "+Ng interest".
- **Intermission** — `WaveManager` no longer auto-advances; on clear it calls
  `onWaveCleared`, and `GameScene` runs a `INTERMISSION_SECONDS` countdown with
  a Skip (Fast Forward) button. Building/upgrading/shopping stay enabled.
  `WaveManager.startNextWave()` begins the next wave (countdown end or Skip).
- **Shop** (`src/ui/ShopPanel.ts`, data in `src/data/powerups.ts`) — a
  persistent button opens the "KaraFence Cash" modal selling one-use power-ups:
  Security Guard (kill all on screen), Encore (`Enemy.rewind` all enemies 10s),
  Sound Check (`TowerManager.damageMultiplier = 2` for 15s). Effects apply on
  purchase.
- **Difficulty scaling** (`DIFFICULTY` / `scaledCount` in `src/data/waves.ts`) —
  each wave index raises enemy count, HP (`Enemy` `hpScale`), and speed
  (`speedScale`) by a small per-wave factor.

## Procedural art (generated textures)

All in-game sprites are **drawn in code at boot** — there are **no image asset
files**. `src/systems/textures.ts` is the single source of art:
`generateTextures(scene)` (called once from `BootScene.preload`) draws every
texture with `Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics` + `generateTexture(key, w, h)` and is
idempotent. Game logic only ever references the string **keys** (`TX.*` and the
`towerTextureKey` / `enemyTextureKey` helpers), so the placeholder art can be
swapped for real imported textures later by changing only what
`generateTextures` produces for a key — no scene/system changes.

- **Tiles** (`TX.tileStage/tileAisle/tileBuild`) and **enemies**
  (`enemyTextureKey`) are drawn in **grayscale** and tinted at use-time — tiles
  to the map's palette in `GameScene.drawMap`, enemies to their type color in
  `Enemy` (so the slow/deflect `setTint` flashes still work). Bosses add a
  separate pulsing **aura** circle (color per `BOSS_AURA`) behind the silhouette.
- **Baked tile accents** (`TX.aisleArrow/buildPlus/lanePill`) are drawn in their
  **real** gold/green colors (NOT tinted) and overlaid on tiles in
  `GameScene.drawMap`, so the readability cues survive any palette: aisles get a
  gold left-chevron (enemy travel direction) + cream lane-divider lines;
  buildable tiles get a green "+" tower-base cue on a faint green wash. Lane
  numbers (`drawLaneMarkers`) sit in `TX.lanePill` dark badges (white digit).
  The aisle/build palette (`DEFAULT_COLORS` in `parseMap`) is a saturated
  red-brown vs. a dark slate-green so the two surfaces read as distinct.
- **Towers** (`towerTextureKey`) are instrument/performer silhouettes on a dark
  base; `Tower.body` is now a `Sprite` (freeze tints it; the ability-ready ring
  has a golden shimmer). **Projectiles** are spun textures (note / music-wave),
  with the drummer's drumsticks + bass pulse rings drawn in `Tower`.
- **Stage**: a curtain backdrop, spotlight cone and singer figure
  (`TX.curtain/spotlight/singer`) composed in `GameScene.drawSinger`. The
  curtain is drawn ~30% narrower than the stage column and left-anchored (a dark
  backstage fill covers the freed strip) so it frames the board rather than
  dominating it; the singer + spotlight center on the narrower curtain.
- **HUD icons + gradient** (`TX.coin/mic/spotIcon/hpFill`) sit in an otherwise
  graphics-drawn HUD (the resizing bars/borders stay as reflowed rects).
- Resolution: textures are generated larger than their on-screen logic size
  (e.g. a 40px tile is drawn at 64px) so they stay crisp when the board scales
  up, sampled NEAREST under `pixelArt: true`.

## Audio + visual polish

- **Audio engine** (`src/systems/audio.ts`) — a scene-independent singleton
  (`audio`) built entirely on the Web Audio API, so the game ships with **no
  audio asset files**. A look-ahead sequencer loops a procedural chiptune
  **track per context** — `menu` / `inWave` (upbeat) / `intermission` (calmer) /
  `boss` (intense) / `gameover` / `victory` — switched via `playMusic(name)`
  from the scenes (MenuScene → menu; GameScene → inWave, with intermission /
  boss / victory / gameover swaps at the matching moments). **SFX** (`sfx(name)`,
  throttled) are one-shot synthesized blips: `shoot`, `hit`, `death`,
  `reachStage`, `gold`, `comboTick` (pitch climbs with the combo), `bossEntrance`,
  `ability`, `waveClear`. Master **mute + volume** persist via
  `storage.ts` (`karafence:audio:v1`) and are exposed through the **pause menu**.
  Audio unlocks on the first user gesture (browser autoplay policy). **To swap in
  real tracks/samples**, replace `playMusic` / `sfx` bodies per the header
  comment in `audio.ts` — call sites and the master bus stay unchanged.
- **Pause menu** — the bottom-bar **≡ Pause** button freezes the run
  (`time.paused` + `tweens.pauseAll`) and shows an overlay with a mute toggle, a
  volume stepper, **Resume**, and **Quit to menu**; it reflows on resize.
- **Visual polish** (mostly `GameScene`, plus `Tower` / `Enemy` / `BootScene`):
  camera **fade** transitions between scenes; **screen shake** on boss hits
  (scaled to damage) and ability activations; **death particle bursts** tinted to
  the enemy's color (`spark` texture generated in `BootScene`); a **ready glow**
  on towers when an ability comes off cooldown; the **Crowd Hype** meter pulses
  continuously at x5+; **smoothly animated** enemy hp/shield bars; and the stage
  **singer bounces** when a foe is silenced near the stage.

## NPM scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the Vite dev server.
- `npm run build` — type-check (`tsc`) then build to `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally.

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which runs
`npm ci && npm run build` and publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages. The Vite
`base` is `/karafence/`, so the site serves from
`https://<user>.github.io/karafence/`.
